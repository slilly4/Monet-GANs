# Monet Painting GAN Mini-Project
#### Introduction to Deep Learning, University of Colorado, Boulder

This project endeavors to use Generative Adversarial Networks to create artwork in the style of the impressionist painter, Claude Monet.  Can we train a machine learning model to create art in a particular style?  I have never attempted such a task before, and I look forward to the opportunity to learn new neural network architectures to accomplish this task.  To achieve this, I will leverage two deep learning architectures.  First, I will employ a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN).  Then, I will see whether better results can be obtained by using CycleGAN.  

The data and guidelines for this task are available on Kaggle, at the following link location:

The competition submission requires the generation of 7,000-10,000 images sized 256x256.
